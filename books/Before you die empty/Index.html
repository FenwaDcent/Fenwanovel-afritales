      <h3>Chapter 1: <span class="meta">The Call to Empty</span></h3>
      <p>[CHAPTER ONE: THE OLD WOODEN CHAIR


(From “Before You Die Empty” — Written by Ajibade Vincent Adefenwa)




The sun was gentle that morning in Akinwale village. The wind moved lazily through the mango trees, shaking their branches with a rhythm that only peace could understand.


Young Samuel sat barefoot on the soft red sand behind their old house. Before him was the wooden chair — that ancient, creaking relic his father refused to throw away.


To Samuel, it wasn’t just a chair.

It was a throne — the seat of wisdom.

Because every time his father sat on it, something about life changed.


“Samuel!” his father’s voice boomed softly from inside the house.

“Yes, Baba!”

“Bring me my old chair. Let’s sit where the wind still remembers.”

Samuel smiled. He knew what that meant. Another story. Another moment that would last forever.

He dragged the chair under the mango tree, the legs scratching the earth, leaving four straight marks on the ground — marks that would later mean more than he could ever imagine.

His father, Pa Akinwale, came out slowly. His white singlet hung loose on his shoulders, and his walking stick tapped the ground like a quiet drumbeat.

He sat down, sighed deeply, and looked at the sky.

“Hmm…”

Samuel knew that sigh. It meant a lesson was coming.


“Samuel,” his father began, “do you know why I like this old chair?”

Samuel shook his head.

“Because it reminds me that everything useful in life must endure pressure. Look at it — old, scratched, but still standing. Some chairs newer than it have already broken. But this one… still holds a man.”

He tapped the armrest with his fingers.

“Purpose is like that, my son. You don’t throw it away just because it no longer looks fine.”

Samuel nodded slowly. He didn’t fully understand, but he could feel the weight of his father’s words.

“Baba, is purpose like a chair too?” he asked innocently.

Pa Akinwale chuckled, his voice deep and kind.

“In a way, yes. You sit on it — not for decoration, but for rest. The man who doesn’t find his purpose will keep standing in life until his strength finishes. But the man who finds it… even when life is hard, he rests.”

Samuel looked at his father’s face — lines of wisdom carved by time and struggle.

Then the old man leaned forward, voice low.

“Come closer.”

Samuel obeyed.

“Do you know what the richest place in this world is?”


Samuel grinned. “America?”

Pa Akinwale burst into laughter. “That’s what everyone says! But no, my son. The richest place in this world is the graveyard.”

Samuel blinked. “The graveyard?”

“Yes,” the old man said, eyes burning now. “Because there you will find books that were never written, songs that were never sung, inventions that were never built. Men and women who died full — of gifts, dreams, and visions — because they were afraid, lazy, or distracted.”

He paused. The air went quiet. Even the leaves seemed to listen

“My son,” he continued, voice trembling slightly, “promise me one thing. Don’t go to that grave full. Die empty.”

The words sank deep. Samuel didn’t know that one sentence would chase him for the rest of his life — through success, through pain, and through every crowd he would one day speak to.

The wind blew again, carrying the smell of mangoes and old wood.

Pa Akinwale stood up slowly. “Alright, go and bring your mother’s broom. Let’s clean this place. Wisdom is not complete until you act on it.”

Samuel smiled, still lost in thought, as he watched his father’s frail frame walk toward the veranda.


That day, the boy who listened beneath the mango tree became a man in the making — though the world would not know it yet.


He didn’t just hear a lesson.

He received a seed.

A seed that would one day grow into the message that would shake nations:

“Before You Die Empty.”

      <h3>Chapter 2: <span class="meta">THE STORY OF THE EMPTY GRAVE</span></h3>
      <p>Night had fallen over Akinwale village.

The moon, full and golden, rested proudly above the thatched roofs, pouring silver light into the compound. The frogs had begun their chorus by the stream, and distant drums echoed from a naming ceremony nearby.



Inside their small sitting room, Samuel’s mother stirred a pot of eko on the clay stove while the scent of roasted plantain drifted through the open window.



Pa Akinwale sat once again on the old wooden chair, that same faithful seat of wisdom. A small kerosene lantern burned beside him, its yellow glow flickering like a heartbeat on the mud walls.



“Samuel,” he called softly.

The boy hurried in, wiping his hands on his shorts.

“Yes, Baba!”


“Sit down. There’s something I didn’t finish saying this morning.”



Samuel sat cross-legged on the cool floor, eyes shining, ready to drink from his father’s words again.



The Tale of Olowolagba



“Many years ago, in this same village,” his father began, “there lived a young man named Olowolagba — people called him Olowo for short. The whole town said he was born with golden hands. He could carve wood until it looked like it could breathe. He could draw faces that felt alive.”


He paused, eyes lost in memory.

“Olowo dreamed big. He told everyone that one day, he would build the biggest furniture company in the region. He said people from the city would travel just to buy his work.”


Samuel listened, resting his chin on his knees.

“But you know what happened?” his father asked quietly.

Samuel shook his head.

“Nothing,” Pa Akinwale said. “Absolutely nothing.”


“Why, Baba?”

“Because Olowo waited for perfect conditions. He said he would start when he had enough money. He said he would build his workshop when he found the right land. He said he would begin when life became easier.”


He sighed.

“Years passed. His friends who started small grew into masters. Some failed, some succeeded — but they moved. Olowo only talked. And when he finally tried to start, old age had caught up with him.”


The kerosene lantern hissed softly, filling the silence.


“One cold harmattan morning,” Pa Akinwale continued, “Olowo caught a fever. Within days, he died. When we buried him, people cried — not just because he was dead, but because of what died inside him.”


Samuel’s eyes widened. “What died inside him, Baba?”


His father looked at him deeply.

“His gifts, Samuel. His dreams. His inventions. His songs. His furniture designs that the world never saw. They all died — with him.”


He leaned forward.

“That, my son, is why I said the graveyard is the richest place on earth. It holds dreams that never lived. Books that were never written. Songs that were never sung. And inventions that never saw the light of day.”



The Lesson

        
Samuel’s young heart beat faster.

“So, Baba… how do I die empty?” he asked softly.


A slow smile formed on Pa Akinwale’s face.

“You live full, my son. You wake up every day and do something about the dream inside you. You write when no one is clapping. You build when no one believes. You sing even if no one listens. You give your best — until there’s nothing left to give.”

He placed his hand on the boy’s shoulder.

“One day, your body will go to the earth, but make sure your purpose has already gone into people.”


Samuel swallowed hard, nodding. The moment sank into his spirit like water into dry soil.

His mother’s voice came from inside the house.

“Samuel! Come and eat before your food gets cold!”

“Yes, Mama!” he replied, but his eyes never left his father’s.


Pa Akinwale smiled again, eyes reflecting the lantern light.

“Remember, my son — the world does not remember talkers. It remembers doers. Whatever you are meant to do, do it now. Because time never waits for those who keep saying, ‘One day.’”

The wind blew gently, carrying the scent of mango leaves through the window. The lantern flame flickered, and the old man’s shadow stretched across the wall — tall, noble, unforgettable.

That night, as Samuel lay on his mat, staring at the ceiling, he whispered the words again and again:

	“The richest place in the world… is the graveyard.”


He didn’t fully understand it yet — but one day, those words would make him a voice to his generation.
