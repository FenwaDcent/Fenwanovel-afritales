      <h4>Chapter 1: The Humble Beginning</h4>
      <div class="content">
        The smell of sawdust filled the small compound behind the old carpenter’s shed. Hammers tapped softly against wood, echoing through the morning calm. That was the rhythm of Mr. Ajibola, the village carpenter — a man who built beds, chairs, and dreams with the same hands that raised his children.<br><br>
        Among the sawdust and sweat, a young boy sat watching, eyes wide with wonder. His name was Samson Ajibola. At twelve, he had already learned how hard the world could be — but he also knew how determination could carve a name out of nothing.<br><br>

      <div class="content">
        The road to Abaji was long, dusty, and full of uncertainty. Samson walked with tired legs and hungry eyes, carrying a small nylon bag that held all he owned... He whispered to himself — “This is where it begins.”
