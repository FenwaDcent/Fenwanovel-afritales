  <h2>Chapter Three — When Love Turns Into Promise</h2>

  <p>The semester was winding down, and Osogbo had that familiar humid air — a mix of dust, rain, and hope. Exams were near. Students were buried in books, prayer, and last-minute group studies.</p>

  <p>Chioma had found her peace. Her days were filled with lectures, study groups, and evening walks with Olabode, her quiet, intelligent boyfriend.</p>

  <p>Olabode wasn’t like the other boys on campus. He didn’t dress flashy, didn’t chase trends, didn’t sweet-talk girls. He was simple — jeans, clean shirts, neat haircut, soft tone. The kind of man whose silence carried meaning.</p>

  <p>They would often sit under the mango tree behind the Faculty of Management, sharing groundnuts and talking about life.</p>

  <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “You know, Chioma, sometimes I look at you and I wonder if women like you still exist.”</p>
  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “Why do you say that?”</p>
  <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “Because you don’t rush anything. You make me believe love can still be pure.”</p>

  <p>She smiled shyly, pretending to focus on peeling the groundnut.</p>

  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “Love should be pure, Bode. If it’s not, then it’s not love — it’s just excitement.”</p>

  <p>They both laughed softly. To others, their relationship looked too quiet. No drama, no public displays, no noise. But between them, it was deep — built on patience, prayer, and genuine affection.</p>

  <p>One evening, while they sat together at a small roadside restaurant in Oke-Baale, Olabode dropped the news.</p>

  <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “Chioma, I’ve been given an opportunity to travel. Canada.”</p>

  <p>The spoon in Chioma’s hand froze.</p>

  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “Canada?”</p>
  <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “Yes. It’s a study-work program. My uncle is helping me process it.”</p>

  <p>Her heart started racing — joy mixed with fear.</p>

  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “That’s… that’s amazing, Bode. But… when?”</p>
  <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “Soon. Maybe before next semester. But I don’t have enough yet. I’m trying to raise the rest.”</p>

  <p>She was quiet for a long time. Then she said softly, “You’ll make it. I believe in you.”</p>

  <p>Over the following weeks, Chioma began to notice something — she was doing everything to help him succeed. She saved from her allowance, cooked for him, helped him fill forms, and even sold some of her clothes online just to send him small support.</p>

  <p>Abiola noticed one day and laughed. <strong>Abiola:</strong> “You this girl ehn, na you dey sponsor your boyfriend. I swear, your head dey touch small.”</p>

  <p>Victoria added teasingly, “You better open your eyes. Men that travel don’t always come back the same.”</p>

  <p>Chioma smiled faintly. “Love is not about who gives more. It’s about who believes more.”</p>

  <p>They both looked at her and sighed. “We just hope your belief won’t turn to tears,” Abiola said quietly.</p>

  <p>Weeks turned into months. Olabode finally got his visa. He was happy — but Chioma’s joy was mixed with fear.</p>

  <p>On his last night before traveling, they met at their usual spot — under the mango tree. The moonlight bathed them both in silver.</p>

  <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “Chioma, I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve done more than I ever imagined.”</p>
  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “Just promise me one thing.”</p>
  <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “Anything.”</p>
  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “Don’t forget me.”</p>

  <p>He reached out and held her hands. His palms were warm, steady.</p>

  <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “I’ll never forget you. You’re part of me. You’re my home.”</p>

  <p>She looked into his eyes, and tears gathered in hers.</p>

  <p>“Then go and make me proud. Don’t make my love look like a mistake.”</p>

  <p>He smiled, kissed her forehead gently, and whispered, “When I return, I’ll marry you.”</p>

  <p>That night, she cried silently in her room. Her friends slept peacefully, but Chioma stayed awake, whispering a prayer only love could understand.</p>

  <p>“God, please let this be love — not another test of faith.”</p>
