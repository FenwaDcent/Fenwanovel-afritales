    <h2>Chapter One — Testimony: the irony of destiny</h2>
    <div class="meta">Written by Ajibade Vincent Adefenwa</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The afternoon sun of Osogbo had a way of sitting quietly on the roofs — warm, soft, almost peaceful.</p>
      <p>Students moved in clusters across the UNIOSUN campus, some laughing, some hurrying, some pretending to hurry.</p>

      <p>But Chioma walked differently. She wasn’t in a rush, yet she wasn’t slow. She walked with purpose — her steps measured, her books neatly held against her chest, her scarf perfectly tied.</p>

      <blockquote>“Chioma, abeg, no vex o, we dey go Club D-Point tonight!”</blockquote>

      <p>That was Abiola’s voice, loud as always, breaking the silence of the path between the library and the hostel. Victoria, beside her, was already giggling.</p>

      <p>Chioma smiled gently. “You two will never change. Is that why you came to school?”</p>

      <p>Abiola rolled her eyes. “Ah ah, my sister, life is not all about books na. You too dey carry everything for head like exam. You no go enjoy small?”</p>

      <p>Victoria joined in, “Abeg leave her jare, Chioma na pastor pikin.”</p>

      <p>They all laughed. But Chioma’s smile faded quickly. She wasn’t offended; she was thinking.</p>

      <blockquote>“If I start following every noise, will my life have meaning?” she said quietly. “My mother’s prayer will be wasted if I fail in this school.”</blockquote>

      <p>Abiola groaned, “See this girl. You dey talk as if we no get sense.”</p>

      <p>Chioma chuckled. “You have sense. But your sense needs direction.”</p>

      <p>That day, after classes, while Abiola and Victoria went to meet their boyfriends near Oke-Baale, Chioma returned to her small hostel room. She placed her books on the bed, knelt down, and whispered a short prayer.</p>

      <blockquote>“Lord, I didn’t come here to impress men. I came to build my future. Keep me focused. Let my heart not go where my destiny will not follow.”</blockquote>

      <p>It was a quiet prayer — but heaven heard.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>Later that week, everything changed. That was the day she met Olabode.</p>

      <p>It was during a group project in the Faculty of Management Sciences. He was tall, calm, and well-spoken — the kind of man whose confidence was natural, not loud. When he smiled, he did it with his eyes more than his lips.</p>

      <p>After their first discussion, Chioma noticed her heart beating faster than usual. She ignored it. She told herself, “Don’t be foolish. You came to study.”</p>

      <p>But destiny smiled a little that day — a kind of smile that humans often mistake for love.</p>

      <p>Weeks passed. They became friends. Then closer friends. Then one evening, by the school fountain, under the fading light of Osogbo’s sunset, he said softly:</p>

      <blockquote>“Chioma, I don’t know how to explain this… but you’ve been the peace I didn’t know I needed.”</blockquote>

      <p>She didn’t answer immediately. She looked down, then up again — her eyes clear, her voice steady.</p>

      <p>“If this is about love, Bode… I only believe in one kind of love — the one that doesn’t destroy destiny.”</p>

      <p>He smiled. “Then let me be part of that destiny.”</p>

      <p>That was how it began. No club, no hookup, no drama — just two souls who believed love could be pure.</p>

    <h2>Chapter Two — The Weekend of Temptation</h2>
    <div class="meta">Written by Ajibade Vincent Adefenwa</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Friday nights at Osun State University had a heartbeat of their own. It began from the buzzing generator sounds to the laughter of students getting ready to “enjoy life.” In Osogbo, even the moon looked like it had rhythm.</p>

      <p>Inside Room 12 of the female hostel, Abiola and Victoria were painting their faces into confidence. Abiola’s voice carried the excitement of a thousand drums.</p>

      <p>“Victoria, hurry up jare! You know how those D-Point boys hate waiting!”</p>

      <p>Victoria, in a tight red gown, smiled into the mirror. “Ah, Bayo said his friend from Lagos will be there tonight. The guy get money! I must look irresistible.”</p>

      <p>Then she turned to Chioma, who sat quietly at the edge of her bed, wearing a plain gown, reading a book titled <em>The Woman of Purpose</em>.</p>

      <p>“Chioma,” she teased, “you no dey tire for all these motivational books? Na so you go carry holy spirit write exam?”</p>

      <p>Chioma smiled faintly. “I’d rather carry Holy Spirit than carry shame.”</p>

      <p>Abiola laughed. “See preacher! You no go come out small? Just small fun. You too dey act like grandma!”</p>

      <p>Chioma looked at them lovingly, her tone gentle but full of truth. “I’m not judging you, my friends. But you see, when we go to certain places, we leave part of ourselves there. Sometimes, the part that never returns.”</p>

      <p>Victoria froze briefly at that line, but quickly brushed it off. “Abeg abeg! You too dey talk like pastor.”</p>

      <p>They both left the room in high spirits, perfume filling the air. The door slammed, and silence returned.</p>

      <p>Chioma sighed deeply. She looked out the window — the campus lights glittering like distant dreams. Down the street, music blared from Club D-Point. Someone was shouting, “DJ play that Fireboy track again!”</p>

      <p>She sat there for a moment, her heart whispering something she didn’t want to admit — loneliness. “Maybe I’m missing out,” she thought for a second. “Maybe they’re right…”</p>

      <p>Then her phone vibrated. It was a message from Olabode. Bode: “Hey, Angel, hope your day was fine?” Chioma: “Yes, just got back from class.” Bode: “You’re not out with your friends?” Chioma: “No, I prefer peace to noise.” Bode: “And that’s why you’re different. I like that about you.”</p>

      <p>Her heart smiled. That simple line — “I like that about you” — filled the space the music couldn’t.</p>

      <p>By midnight, Abiola and Victoria stumbled in, laughing loudly. Their makeup was smeared; their eyes carried both joy and exhaustion. “Chioma! You missed!” Abiola shouted. “Ah! You should have seen the place — drinks everywhere, DJ mad, guys fine!”</p>

      <p>Chioma looked up from her bed. “Did you enjoy it?” Abiola hesitated, giggled, then said, “Well… let’s just say we tried.” Victoria kicked off her heels. “One guy just dey toast me, but he no even get sense. I swear, boys are all the same.”</p>

      <p>Chioma smiled quietly, got up, and covered them with a blanket. “Sleep,” she said softly. “Your body may be tired, but make sure your heart doesn’t get tired too.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter Three — When Love Turns Into Promise</h2>
    <div class="meta">Written by Ajibade Vincent Adefenwa</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The semester was winding down, and Osogbo had that familiar humid air — a mix of dust, rain, and hope. Exams were near. Students were buried in books, prayer, and last-minute group studies.</p>

      <p>Chioma had found her peace. Her days were filled with lectures, study groups, and evening walks with Olabode, her quiet, intelligent boyfriend.</p>

      <p>Olabode wasn’t like the other boys on campus. He didn’t dress flashy, didn’t chase trends, didn’t sweet-talk girls. He was simple — jeans, clean shirts, neat haircut, soft tone. The kind of man whose silence carried meaning.</p>

      <p>They would often sit under the mango tree behind the Faculty of Management, sharing groundnuts and talking about life.</p>

      <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “You know, Chioma, sometimes I look at you and I wonder if women like you still exist.”</p>
      <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “Why do you say that?”</p>
      <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “Because you don’t rush anything. You make me believe love can still be pure.”</p>

      <p>She smiled shyly, pretending to focus on peeling the groundnut. “Love should be pure, Bode. If it’s not, then it’s not love — it’s just excitement.”</p>

      <p>One evening, while they sat together at a small roadside restaurant in Oke-Baale, Olabode dropped the news. <strong>Bode:</strong> “Chioma, I’ve been given an opportunity to travel. Canada.”</p>

      <p>The spoon in Chioma’s hand froze. Chioma: “Canada?” Bode: “Yes. It’s a study-work program. My uncle is helping me process it.”</p>

      <p>Her heart started racing — joy mixed with fear. Chioma: “That’s… that’s amazing, Bode. But… when?” Bode: “Soon. Maybe before next semester. But I don’t have enough yet. I’m trying to raise the rest.”</p>

      <p>She was quiet for a long time. Then she said softly, “You’ll make it. I believe in you.”</p>

      <p>Over the following weeks, Chioma began to notice something — she was doing everything to help him succeed. She saved from her allowance, cooked for him, helped him fill forms, and even sold some of her clothes online just to send him small support.</p>

      <p>Abiola noticed one day and laughed. “You this girl ehn, na you dey sponsor your boyfriend. I swear, your head dey touch small.” Victoria added teasingly, “You better open your eyes. Men that travel don’t always come back the same.”</p>

      <p>Weeks turned into months. Olabode finally got his visa. He was happy — but Chioma’s joy was mixed with fear.</p>

      <p>On his last night before traveling, they met at their usual spot — under the mango tree. The moonlight bathed them both in silver. Bode: “Chioma, I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve done more than I ever imagined.” Chioma: “Just promise me one thing.” Bode: “Anything.” Chioma: “Don’t forget me.”</p>

      <p>He reached out and held her hands. “I’ll never forget you. You’re part of me. You’re my home.” She looked into his eyes, and tears gathered in hers. “Then go and make me proud. Don’t make my love look like a mistake.” He smiled, kissed her forehead gently, and whispered, “When I return, I’ll marry you.”</p>

      <hr />
      <p><em>💭 Message:</em> Sometimes love looks like a promise, but destiny sees it as a lesson. When you give your heart, make sure it’s not the only thing you have left to live with.</p>

  <section id="ch4" class="chapter" data-ch="4">
    <h2>Chapter Four — The Empty Side of Love</h2>
    <div class="meta">Written by Ajibade Vincent Adefenwa</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Three months had passed since Olabode traveled to Canada. At first, the distance didn’t feel real — he called every night, sent pictures, and made her laugh with stories of snow, cold weather, and how he missed Nigerian food.</p>

      <p>But as time went on, his voice became like a radio with weak signal — still there, but fading.</p>

      <p>It was a cool Saturday evening in Osogbo. The hostel was quiet. Abiola had gone to visit her new boyfriend in Ede, and Victoria was in Ibadan for a wedding.</p>

      <p>Chioma sat alone by the window, reading an old chat from Olabode. “I’ll never forget you.” “You’re my home.” “When I return, I’ll marry you.” Her phone screen showed “Last seen 2 days ago.” She dropped it slowly and whispered, “Maybe he’s just busy… maybe his internet is bad.”</p>

      <p>Deep inside, a small ache had started — the kind that doesn’t make noise, but burns quietly like candle flame.</p>

      <p>By December, the distance had become a stranger between them. He still sent short messages — “I’m busy, Chioma,” “Network is bad,” “Talk later.” But later never came.</p>

      <p>Abiola noticed the change. Abiola: “Chioma, this your boyfriend don dey show colour o.” Chioma: “No, he’s just busy.” Abiola: “Busy for three months? Na Canada he go or heaven?” Victoria added softly, “Don’t love someone so much that you forget to love yourself.” Chioma smiled sadly. “Love is patience, my friends.” Victoria shook her head. “Sometimes patience is just how we spell denial.”</p>

      <p>That night, Chioma cried for the first time. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t dramatic. Just quiet tears soaking her pillow while the sound of rain fell on the hostel roof. “God,” she whispered, “if this is love, please let it come back to me. But if it’s not, give me peace to let it go.”</p>

      <p>Weeks turned to months. She sent birthday wishes — no reply. She sent prayers — only blue ticks. Then one evening, Victoria came running into the hostel room with her phone in hand. On the screen was a Facebook post — “Congratulations to Mr. & Mrs. Olabode Adeshina – Just Married, Toronto, Canada.” Chioma stared at it. Her lips trembled, but no word came out. She looked away, then whispered, “So that’s how promises die… quietly.”</p>

      <p>Later that night, she wrote in her diary: “Dear Bode, I’m happy you found someone. Maybe I was your peace, but not your future. I don’t hate you. I just wish you had told me the truth early — so I could have stopped praying for a ghost. Love still lives in me. It’s just wiser now. — Chioma.”</p>
