  <h3>Chapter 1: <span class="meta">Innocence in Osogbo</span></h3>
  <p><em>Testimony: the irony of destiny — Written by Ajibade Vincent Adefenwa</em></p>

  <p>The afternoon sun of Osogbo had a way of sitting quietly on the roofs — warm, soft, almost peaceful. Students moved in clusters across the UNIOSUN campus, some laughing, some hurrying, some pretending to hurry. But Chioma walked differently. She wasn’t in a rush, yet she wasn’t slow. She walked with purpose — her steps measured, her books neatly held against her chest, her scarf perfectly tied.</p>

  <p><strong>“Chioma, abeg, no vex o, we dey go Club D-Point tonight!”</strong></p>

  <p>That was Abiola’s voice, loud as always, breaking the silence of the path between the library and the hostel. Victoria, beside her, was already giggling.</p>

  <p>Chioma smiled gently. “You two will never change. Is that why you came to school?”</p>

  <p>Abiola rolled her eyes. “Ah ah, my sister, life is not all about books na. You too dey carry everything for head like exam. You no go enjoy small?”</p>

  <p>Victoria joined in, “Abeg leave her jare, Chioma na pastor pikin.”</p>

  <p>They all laughed. But Chioma’s smile faded quickly. She wasn’t offended; she was thinking.</p>

  <p><strong>“If I start following every noise, will my life have meaning?”</strong> she said quietly. “My mother’s prayer will be wasted if I fail in this school.”</p>

  <p>Abiola groaned, “See this girl. You dey talk as if we no get sense.”</p>

  <p>Chioma chuckled. “You have sense. But your sense needs direction.”</p>

  <p>That day, after classes, while Abiola and Victoria went to meet their boyfriends near Oke-Baale, Chioma returned to her small hostel room. She placed her books on the bed, knelt down, and whispered a short prayer.</p>

  <p><strong>“Lord, I didn’t come here to impress men. I came to build my future. Keep me focused. Let my heart not go where my destiny will not follow.”</strong></p>

  <p>It was a quiet prayer — but heaven heard.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Later that week, everything changed. That was the day she met Olabode. It was during a group project in the Faculty of Management Sciences. He was tall, calm, and well-spoken — the kind of man whose confidence was natural, not loud. When he smiled, he did it with his eyes more than his lips.</p>

  <p>After their first discussion, Chioma noticed her heart beating faster than usual. She ignored it. She told herself, “Don’t be foolish. You came to study.” But destiny smiled a little that day — a kind of smile that humans often mistake for love.</p>

  <p>Weeks passed. They became friends. Then closer friends. Then one evening, by the school fountain, under the fading light of Osogbo’s sunset, he said softly: <strong>“Chioma, I don’t know how to explain this… but you’ve been the peace I didn’t know I needed.”</strong></p>

  <p>She didn’t answer immediately. She looked down, then up again — her eyes clear, her voice steady. “If this is about love, Bode… I only believe in one kind of love — the one that doesn’t destroy destiny.”</p>

  <p>He smiled. “Then let me be part of that destiny.” That was how it began. No club, no hookup, no drama — just two souls who believed love could be pure.</p>

  <p>But love, like Osogbo’s weather, can change without warning. Sometimes the same sun that warmed your skin will later burn it.</p>

  <p><strong>💭 Moral (end of Chapter 1):</strong> A pure heart may not stop the storms of life — but it keeps you standing when they come. In a world where many chase pleasure, Chioma chose purpose. But destiny… had its own script.</p>

  <h3>Chapter 2: <span class="meta">The Weekend of Temptation</span></h3>
  <p><em>Written by Ajibade Vincent Adefenwa</em></p>

  <p>Friday nights at Osun State University had a heartbeat of their own. It began from the buzzing generator sounds to the laughter of students getting ready to “enjoy life.” In Osogbo, even the moon looked like it had rhythm.</p>

  <p>Inside Room 12 of the female hostel, Abiola and Victoria were painting their faces into confidence.</p>

  <p><strong>“Victoria, hurry up jare! You know how those D-Point boys hate waiting!”</strong></p>

  <p>Victoria, in a tight red gown, smiled into the mirror. <strong>“Ah, Bayo said his friend from Lagos will be there tonight. The guy get money! I must look irresistible.”</strong></p>

  <p>Then she turned to Chioma, who sat quietly at the edge of her bed, wearing a plain gown, reading a book titled <em>The Woman of Purpose</em>.</p>

  <p><strong>“Chioma,”</strong> she teased, <strong>“you no dey tire for all these motivational books? Na so you go carry holy spirit write exam?”</strong></p>

  <p>Chioma smiled faintly. <strong>“I’d rather carry Holy Spirit than carry shame.”</strong></p>

  <p>Abiola laughed. “See preacher! You no go come out small? Just small fun. You too dey act like grandma!”</p>

  <p>Chioma looked at them lovingly, her tone gentle but full of truth. <strong>“I’m not judging you, my friends. But you see, when we go to certain places, we leave part of ourselves there. Sometimes, the part that never returns.”</strong></p>

  <p>They left for Club D-Point. The door slammed. Silence returned. Chioma sighed and stared at the campus lights. Down the street, music blared. For a moment, loneliness whispered, <em>Maybe I’m missing out…</em></p>

  <p>Her phone vibrated. A message from Olabode: <strong>“Hey, Angel, hope your day was fine?”</strong> … <strong>“You’re not out with your friends?”</strong> … <strong>“And that’s why you’re different. I like that about you.”</strong></p>

  <p>By midnight, the girls stumbled back in, makeup smeared, laughter thin.</p>

  <p><strong>“Did you enjoy it?”</strong> Chioma asked softly.</p>

  <p>Abiola hesitated, then giggled, “Well… let’s just say we tried.” Victoria kicked off her heels. “One guy just dey toast me, but he no even get sense. I swear, boys are all the same.”</p>

  <p>Chioma covered them with a blanket. <strong>“Sleep. Your body may be tired, but make sure your heart doesn’t get tired too.”</strong></p>

  <p>She whispered to herself, <strong>“Some people dance their pain away… others read their way out of it.”</strong></p>

  <p><strong>💭 Message of Chapter 2:</strong> Not every fun is joy. Not every noise is happiness. Some peace looks boring until life’s storms come — then you’ll know what real joy feels like.</p>

  <h3>Chapter 3: <span class="meta">When Love Turns Into Promise</span></h3>
  <p><em>Written by Ajibade Vincent Adefenwa</em></p>

  <p>The semester wound down; exams neared. Chioma found her peace: lectures, study groups, evening walks with Olabode — quiet, grounded, sincere. To others, their love looked too calm; to them, it was deep.</p>

  <p>One evening at Oke-Baale, Olabode said, <strong>“I’ve been given an opportunity to travel. Canada.”</strong> Her spoon froze. <strong>“When?”</strong> — “Soon… I’m trying to raise the rest.”</p>

  <p>She believed and helped: saved allowances, cooked, filled forms, even sold clothes. Friends mocked gently: <strong>“Open your eyes o. Men that travel don’t always come back the same.”</strong> Chioma smiled: <strong>“Love is not about who gives more. It’s about who believes more.”</strong></p>

  <p>Visa approved. Under the mango tree, on his last night, she said, <strong>“Promise me you won’t forget me.”</strong> He held her hands: <strong>“You’re my home… When I return, I’ll marry you.”</strong></p>

  <p>That night she cried quietly and prayed, <strong>“God, please let this be love — not another test of faith.”</strong></p>

  <p><strong>💭 Message of Chapter 3:</strong> Sometimes love looks like a promise, but destiny sees it as a lesson. When you give your heart, make sure it’s not the only thing you have left to live with.</p>

  <h3>Chapter 4: <span class="meta">The Empty Side of Love</span></h3>
  <p><em>Written by Ajibade Vincent Adefenwa</em></p>

  <p>Three months after Olabode travelled, distance became a stranger between them. Calls faded into “Network is bad” and “Talk later.” Later never came.</p>

  <p>Chioma wrote in her diary at the campus library: <em>“Dear Bode… I’m proud of you. I pray for you every night. Sometimes, I just wish I could hear you say ‘Chioma, I’m fine.’”</em></p>

  <p>By December, the ache burned quietly. Friends warned gently: <strong>“Sometimes patience is how we spell denial.”</strong> That night she cried for the first time: <strong>“If this is love, let it return. If not, give me peace to let it go.”</strong></p>

  <p>Then Victoria arrived with a phone in hand — a Facebook post: <strong>“Congratulations to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Olabode Adeshina – Just Married, Toronto, Canada.”</strong></p>

  <p>Chioma stared, lips trembling. <strong>“So that’s how promises die… quietly.”</strong></p>

  <p>Later, she wrote: <em>“Dear Bode, I’m happy you found someone. Maybe I was your peace, but not your future. I don’t hate you. Life has taught me the lesson your absence couldn’t. Love still lives in me. It’s just wiser now.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>💭 Message of Chapter 4:</strong> Sometimes love doesn’t die suddenly — it fades quietly, one ignored message at a time. People will leave, but the lessons will stay. Heartbreak becomes holy when it purifies what’s left of your soul.</p>
