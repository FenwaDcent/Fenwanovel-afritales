  <h2>Chapter Two — The Weekend of Temptation</h2>

  <p>Friday nights at Osun State University had a heartbeat of their own. It began from the buzzing generator sounds to the laughter of students getting ready to “enjoy life.” In Osogbo, even the moon looked like it had rhythm.</p>

  <p>Inside Room 12 of the female hostel, Abiola and Victoria were painting their faces into confidence.</p>

  <p><strong>Abiola:</strong> “Victoria, hurry up jare! You know how those D-Point boys hate waiting!”</p>

  <p>Victoria, in a tight red gown, smiled into the mirror.</p>

  <p><strong>Victoria:</strong> “Ah, Bayo said his friend from Lagos will be there tonight. The guy get money! I must look irresistible.”</p>

  <p>Then she turned to Chioma, who sat quietly at the edge of her bed, wearing a plain gown, reading a book titled <em>The Woman of Purpose</em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Victoria (teasing):</strong> “Chioma, you no dey tire for all these motivational books? Na so you go carry holy spirit write exam?”</p>

  <p>Chioma smiled faintly.</p>

  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “I’d rather carry Holy Spirit than carry shame.”</p>

  <p>Abiola laughed. “See preacher! You no go come out small? Just small fun. You too dey act like grandma!”</p>

  <p>Chioma looked at them lovingly, her tone gentle but full of truth.</p>

  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “I’m not judging you, my friends. But you see, when we go to certain places, we leave part of ourselves there. Sometimes, the part that never returns.”</p>

  <p>Victoria froze briefly at that line, but quickly brushed it off. “Abeg abeg! You too dey talk like pastor.”</p>

  <p>They both left the room in high spirits, perfume filling the air.</p>

  <p>The door slammed, and silence returned.</p>

  <p>Chioma sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>She looked out the window — the campus lights glittering like distant dreams. Down the street, music blared from Club D-Point. Someone was shouting, “DJ play that Fireboy track again!”</p>

  <p>She sat there for a moment, her heart whispering something she didn’t want to admit — loneliness.</p>

  <p><strong>Chioma (to herself):</strong> “Maybe I’m missing out. Maybe they’re right…”</p>

  <p>Then her phone vibrated. It was a message from Olabode.</p>

  <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “Hey, Angel, hope your day was fine?”</p>
  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “Yes, just got back from class.”</p>
  <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “You’re not out with your friends?”</p>
  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “No, I prefer peace to noise.”</p>
  <p><strong>Bode:</strong> “And that’s why you’re different. I like that about you.”</p>

  <p>Her heart smiled.</p>

  <p>By midnight, the door creaked open. Abiola and Victoria stumbled in, laughing loudly. Their makeup was smeared; their eyes carried both joy and exhaustion.</p>

  <p><strong>Abiola:</strong> “Chioma! You missed! Ah! You should have seen the place — drinks everywhere, DJ mad, guys fine!”</p>

  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “Did you enjoy it?”</p>

  <p>Abiola hesitated, giggled, then said, “Well… let’s just say we tried.” Victoria kicked off her heels. “One guy just dey toast me, but he no even get sense. I swear, boys are all the same.”</p>

  <p>Chioma smiled quietly, got up, and covered them with a blanket.</p>

  <p><strong>Chioma:</strong> “Sleep. Your body may be tired, but make sure your heart doesn’t get tired too.”</p>

  <p>They were already half asleep when she whispered, almost to herself, “Some people dance their pain away… others read their way out of it.”</p>
