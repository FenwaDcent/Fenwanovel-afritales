<h2>Chapter One — Testimony: the irony of destiny</h2>
<p>The afternoon sun of Osogbo had a way of sitting quietly on the roofs — warm, soft, almost peaceful.</p>
<p>Students moved in clusters across the UNIOSUN campus, some laughing, some hurrying, some pretending to hurry.</p>
<p>But Chioma walked differently. She wasn’t in a rush, yet she wasn’t slow. She walked with purpose — her steps measured, her books neatly held against her chest, her scarf perfectly tied.</p>
<blockquote>“Chioma, abeg, no vex o, we dey go Club D-Point tonight!”</blockquote>
<p>That was Abiola’s voice, loud as always, breaking the silence of the path between the library and the hostel. Victoria, beside her, was already giggling.</p>
<p>Chioma smiled gently. “You two will never change. Is that why you came to school?”</p>
<p>Weeks passed. They became friends. Then closer friends.</p>
<p>Then one evening, by the school fountain, under the fading light of Osogbo’s sunset, he said softly:</p>
<blockquote>“Chioma, I don’t know how to explain this… but you’ve been the peace I didn’t know I needed.”</blockquote>
