  <h2>Chapter One — Testimony: the irony of destiny</h2>

  <p>The afternoon sun of Osogbo had a way of sitting quietly on the roofs — warm, soft, almost peaceful.</p>

  <p>Students moved in clusters across the UNIOSUN campus, some laughing, some hurrying, some pretending to hurry.</p>

  <p>But Chioma walked differently.</p>

  <p>She wasn’t in a rush, yet she wasn’t slow. She walked with purpose — her steps measured, her books neatly held against her chest, her scarf perfectly tied.</p>

  <blockquote>“Chioma, abeg, no vex o, we dey go Club D-Point tonight!”</blockquote>

  <p>That was Abiola’s voice, loud as always, breaking the silence of the path between the library and the hostel. Victoria, beside her, was already giggling.</p>

  <p>Chioma smiled gently. “You two will never change. Is that why you came to school?”</p>

  <p>Abiola rolled her eyes. “Ah ah, my sister, life is not all about books na. You too dey carry everything for head like exam. You no go enjoy small?”</p>

  <p>Victoria joined in, “Abeg leave her jare, Chioma na pastor pikin.”</p>

  <p>They all laughed. But Chioma’s smile faded quickly.</p>

  <blockquote>“If I start following every noise, will my life have meaning?” she said quietly. “My mother’s prayer will be wasted if I fail in this school.”</blockquote>

  <p>That day, after classes, while Abiola and Victoria went to meet their boyfriends near Oke-Baale, Chioma returned to her small hostel room. She placed her books on the bed, knelt down, and whispered a short prayer.</p>

  <p>“Lord, I didn’t come here to impress men. I came to build my future. Keep me focused. Let my heart not go where my destiny will not follow.”</p>

  <p>It was a quiet prayer — but heaven heard.</p>

  <p>Later that week, everything changed.</p>

  <p>That was the day she met Olabode.</p>

  <p>It was during a group project in the Faculty of Management Sciences. He was tall, calm, and well-spoken — the kind of man whose confidence was natural, not loud.</p>

  <p>When he smiled, he did it with his eyes more than his lips.</p>

  <p>After their first discussion, Chioma noticed her heart beating faster than usual.</p>

  <p>She ignored it. She told herself, “Don’t be foolish. You came to study.”</p>

  <p>But destiny smiled a little that day — a kind of smile that humans often mistake for love.</p>

  <p>Weeks passed.</p>

  <p>They became friends.</p>

  <p>Then closer friends.</p>

  <p>Then one evening, by the school fountain, under the fading light of Osogbo’s sunset, he said softly:</p>

  <blockquote>“Chioma, I don’t know how to explain this… but you’ve been the peace I didn’t know I needed.”</blockquote>

  <p>She didn’t answer immediately.</p>

  <p>She looked down, then up again — her eyes clear, her voice steady.</p>

  <p>“If this is about love, Bode… I only believe in one kind of love — the one that doesn’t destroy destiny.”</p>

  <p>He smiled. “Then let me be part of that destiny.”</p>

  <p>That was how it began.</p>

  <p>No club, no hookup, no drama — just two souls who believed love could be pure.</p>
